<p>I’ve worked on 5+ apps using <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture">The Composable Architecture</a> and I really like it but I’ve observed few issues that we can run into in bigger apps.</p>

<p>As you probably know I’m also a big proponent of <a href="https://merowing.info/2017/01/testing-ios-apps/">TDD / BDD</a>, so let’s start by talking about what I don’t like about the way TCA does testing.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="what-does-exhaustivity-mean">What does exhaustivity mean?</h2>

<p>Exhaustivity in the context of TCA tests means every test you perform has to replicate <strong>all the actions, state changes, and effects</strong> steaming from the first trigger you want to verify.</p>

<p>This means that you usually will write a single test for each action you have in your application.</p>

<p><em>This sounds good on the surface right?</em></p>

<p>It leads to a code that has a lot of TDD anti-patterns. Let’s get into the details.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-tdd">Benefits of TDD</h2>

<p>If you read my <a href="https://merowing.info/2017/01/testing-ios-apps/">Best practices for testing apps</a> you might remember that I do TDD for a few different reasons.</p>

<p>Let’s highlight the 2 most important ones in the context of TCA.</p>

<h3 id="confidence-to-refactor-internal-implementation-details-without-breaking-expected-behavior">Confidence to refactor internal implementation details without breaking expected behavior</h3>

<p>When we write new tests we want to through the process of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Red</strong> - Write failing test for non-existent (empty) API</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> - Implement minimal code to make the test pass</li>
<li><strong>Refactor</strong> - Change implementation detail without breaking the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the key factor here is that once the test is Green, it should usually not change as we change the implementation.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p><strong>Why does that matter?</strong></p>

<p>It gives us the confidence to constantly refactor and improve implementation details, and if our tests are passing without any changes we know we aren’t breaking consumer/user expectations (assuming decent test coverage).</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>That confidence is even more important in the long-term maintenance of our codebase, if we need to change tests when our implementation changes it means that they are <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>This <strong>fragility</strong> is one of the most common anti-patterns in TDD and why a lot of people that are new to testing end up saying testing isn’t worth it.</p>

<h3 id="a-single-test-should-focus-and-verify-a-single-side-effect">A single test should focus and verify a single side-effect</h3>

<p>If you need to analyze your test each time it fails, it probably means your test is doing way more than it should.</p>

<p>Test failure should be clear and concise, you should immediately know what failed. They also serve for good documentation of expected behavior when they are focused.</p>

<p>As such even if a single user action causes N side-effects, it’s better to create N tests rather than 1 test with N assertions.</p>

<p>It’s also part of <a href="https://marabesi.com/tdd/2021/08/28/tdd-anti-patterns.html#:~:text=In%20TDD%20the%20giant%20often%20relates%20to%20many%20assertions%20in%20a%20single%20test%20case%20as%20Dave%20Farley%20depicts%20on%20his%20video"><strong>The giant anti-pattern</strong></a></p>

<h2 id="tca-exhaustive-tests">TCA Exhaustive tests</h2>

<p>Exhaustive tests by design fail the 2 main benefits we just talked about.</p>

<p>Your tests will need to verify every single assertion and almost any changes in your implementation details will cause you to have to update your tests, making them <strong>extremely fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>As an example, one of the tests to verify what happens when the user closes a tab in <a href="https://thebrowser.company"><strong>ARC Browser</strong></a> was <strong>100+ lines of code</strong>, without even counting the code to set it up and that’s not even the biggest test we had.</p>

<p>Do you know what I’ve seen happen in apps that have tests like this, time and time again?</p>

<ul>
<li>People stop writing new tests because it’s too complicated</li>
<li>When the old test fails, folks will just copy the expectation to make the test pass.

<ul>
<li>Without really analyzing the logic, because it’s too complicated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When a test fails it’s hard to understand why it failed because you have to read everything in it, it’s not fun to read 100+ lines of test code to try to understand what’s going on</li>
<li>Even re-ordering events will cause tests to fail</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="coming-up-with-alternative">Coming up with alternative</h1>

<p>When I started working at <a href="https://thebrowser.company">The Browser Company</a> I kicked off a discussion about those issues that I’ve observed.</p>

<p>These are the proposal requirements I’ve come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-exhaustive</li>
<li>Devs decide which state changes to assert and which to ignore</li>
<li>Need to be able to verify effect actions were received</li>
<li>Effects are processed as normal (not waiting for receive)</li>
<li>Tests can finish successfully even with long-running effects still active

<ul>
<li>We still want to be able to ensure they did in-fact finish (opt-in)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to keep API as close as possible to the original to be able to choose when we want <code>.exhaustive</code> tests and when we want to have <code>.nonExhaustive</code>

<ul>
<li>Since there are still places when exhaustive can make sense (think TDD vs BDD testing differences)</li>
<li>e.g. <code>let store = TestStore(.nonExhaustive, ...)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Additionally offer the ability to access state outside of <code>send</code> blocks for standard <code>XCTAssert</code> testing</li>
</ul>

<p>After discussing and clearing this with the team I proposed a new API.</p>

<h2 id="new-api">New API</h2>

<p><strong>Reference sample state / actions for the samples</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">struct State: Equatable {
        var name: String = &quot;Krzysztof&quot;
        var surname: String = &quot;Zabłocki&quot;
        var age: Int = 33
        var mood: Int = 0
    }
    
enum Action: Equatable {
    case changeIdentity(name: String, surname: String)
    case changeAge(Int)
    case changeMood(Int)
    case advanceAgeAndMoodAfterDelay
}
    
let reducer = Reducer&lt;State, Action, AnySchedulerOf&lt;DispatchQueue&gt;&gt; { state, action, scheduler in
    switch action {
    case let .changeIdentity(name, surname):
        state.name = name
        state.surname = surname
        return .none
        
    case .advanceAgeAndMoodAfterDelay:
        return .merge(
            .init(value: .changeAge(state.age + 1)),
            .init(value: .changeMood(state.mood + 1))
        )
            .delay(for: 1, scheduler: scheduler)
            .eraseToEffect()
        
    case let .changeAge(age):
        state.age = age
        return .none
    case let .changeMood(mood):
        state.mood = mood
        return .none
    }
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Verifying state happens inside send or receive blocks, same as in original TestStore, but in a non-exhaustive manner, meaning that if your reducer modifies many state properties, you can simply ignore the ones you don&rsquo;t care about, e.g.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-swift">store.send(.changeIdentity(name: &quot;Marek&quot;, surname: &quot;Ignored&quot;)) {
  $0.name = &quot;Marek&quot;
  // we don't verify surname since we don't care
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>You can send multiple actions without asserting any state changes, and verify state change in last send block</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-swift">store.send(.changeIdentity(name: &quot;Adam&quot;, surname: &quot;Stern&quot;))
store.send(.changeIdentity(name: &quot;Piotr&quot;, surname: &quot;Galiszewski&quot;))

// Verify final state matches
store.send(.changeIdentity(name: &quot;Merowing&quot;, surname: &quot;Info&quot;)) {
  $0.name = &quot;Merowing&quot;
  $0.surname = &quot;Info&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>You can verify actions received from effects and state changes by using final block, but unlike a standard store, do it in a non-exhaustive manner, e.g. here we only check we get changeAge and ignore changeMood effect callback</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-swift">store.send(.advanceAgeAndMoodAfterDelay)
        
// When moving scheduler forward in time
testScheduler.advance(by: 1)
        
// Verify that it received delayed action and updated state 
// note that we choose ignore checking for whether `changeMood` was received
store.receive(.changeAge(34)) {
  $0.age = 34
} 
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use an alternative approach for the final check:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">XCTAssertEqual(store.state.age, 34)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="converting-from-exhaustive-to-non-exhaustive-tests">Converting from Exhaustive to Non-Exhaustive tests</h2>

<ul>
<li>Given N behaviors you were verifying in a single test

<ul>
<li>Split that 1 test across N tests with common setup</li>
<li>Copy the implementation and then remove assertions unrelated to the behavior under test</li>
<li>Your exhaustive test probably has many crufty checks that were irrelevant to the test but needed to pass the exhaustivity test. Now that this test is non-exhaustive, delete as many of these as you can to keep your tests focused and easy to understand.</li>
<li>You should be able to drop most, if not all store.receive calls — since this was testing for effects that are usually implementation details, in most cases, you don’t want to be testing them in a non-exhaustive world.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This focuses your tests on a small surface area as possible, it’s better to split one big test into N small tests around different side-effects of action because if the code introduces a bug only some of them will fail, making it much clearer what broke.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are using state mutations as functions of your State objects e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">state.doSomething()
</code></pre>

<p>Try to avoid doing that in tests and instead rely on setting the state changes explicitly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those functions will depend on previous state values</li>
<li>They are an implementation detail and if you introduce a bug in them your test won’t fail anymore, defeating the purpose of the test existing in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-this-give-us">What does this give us?</h2>

<p>This pattern will mean we test less logic in a single test, so we need to have a higher number of tests to match up coverage but it&rsquo;s a good thing because:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are duplicating less of an implementation detail (especially side-effects relationships)</li>
<li>Tests are easier to read because they are focused</li>
<li>If we introduce regression it should only break tests that exercised that part of application behavior not everything</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>These problems might not be visible in smaller-scale projects, but they still exist. They are very visible in larger projects, FYI our Browser is one of the biggest clients of the TCA framework.</p>

<p>If you don’t like exhaustivity and agree with my thoughts about it, you can start using the proposed test store implementation today, it’s available as <a href="https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-composable-architecture/blob/develop/Sources/ComposableArchitecture/TestSupport/TBCTestStore.swift"><code>TBCTestStore</code></a> under our <a href="https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-composable-architecture/tree/develop">develop fork of TCA</a> which we keep up-to-date with the original repo.</p>
